As a software engineer with four years of experience in Python, SQL, C#, and JavaScript, I am transitioning my career toward my passion: cybersecurity. My programming background provides a strong understanding of system design and development, laying a solid foundation for tackling security challenges. My interest in cybersecurity sparked during a senior-year Capture The Flag (CTF) course, which captivated me and set the direction for my future. With an analytical mindset, keen attention to detail, and the ability to communicate technical concepts clearly, I am excited to begin my cybersecurity journey as an entry-level security analyst. I look forward to contributing to organizational security while growing in this dynamic and critical field.
